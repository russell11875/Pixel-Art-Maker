## Instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

I started my project with creating the variables Height, width, & color. 

Next, I created the event button. So when you select the submit button it calls an action to be done. 

Then, the code checks whether or not a table already exists. If there is, the code is set to remove or reset to nothing. 

The next piece of code creates a table based on the users input for height & width. Once you select the submit button the table is then created. 

Finally, the last piece of code adds or removes color. Depending on whether a box has been selected. The code will either add color or remove color from any of the selected boxes.
